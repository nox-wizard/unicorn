Legend: from 2003/04/10 I use UG for tell that is an Unicorn GM-Tool related
stuff, and UR for tell that is an Unicorn's Rainbow one, UC is Unicorn's
Calling, UH is Herald.
If there is no prefix, the change is common to all the Unicorn Suite's projects.
(Common code or a deployed change).

2003/04/27
 - UR: Clicking with right mouse button you can jump to a specified color index.
   For now you can only insert decimal indexes. If the index is < 1, is 1 the
   index actually used.
 - Installer: now the dlls are downloaded from internet by the installer if it
   can't find them in system directory.
 - UG: Now the xss parser set as subsection name the filename of the script
   where the item or char is.

2003/04/26
 - UG: Launcher: Defaulted the port for clients to 2593 when adding a new one.
 - UR: Corrected the hues index shown (was -1)

Release 0.3
2003/04/26
 - Moved to NSIS 2b3a (I forgot to update it :/ )

2003/04/22
 - UH: Now it downloads and parses rightly the RSS Feed. I need an HTML renderer
   for show it well.
 - UG: changed Launcher to use Stringize function for rightly manage null values

2003/04/22
 - Work In Progress Unicorn Suite:
   * Decided names for hues editor and remote console: Unicorn's Rainbow and
     Unicorn's Calling. Thanks a lot to Skyfire, without her this suite's never
     be release. (Note: references to codename is removed from the doc: only the
     actuals names will be public)
 - Imported Unicorn's sources into noxwizard sourceforge project's cvs.
 - UG: Fixed bugs 0000008 and 0000010 (see Mantis Bugs Tracker).

2003/04/18
 - Work In Progress Unicorn Suite:
   * Start working on Unicorn's Herald, that receive news from the RSS Feed of
     SourceForge.net and show them ;)
 - UR: Now it read the right UO directory from registry
 - Wrapped GetSetupNode to the newly created GetNode (UtilUnit)

2003/04/17
 - Work In Progress Unicorn Suite:
   * Created Unicorn's Telekinesis Project. Telekinesis is the remote console
     client. Remote console client included in previous unicorn versions is now
     obsolete and was removed.
   * Ported the Error Handling Code to Common Abstracted Code Base. Now can be
     used in the rest of Unicorn Suite.
 - UC: Removed AMX related remote console command. They made no sense, probably
   will be removed also from NoX Remote Console.
 - UG: Removed Version Control code. It was made obsolete from the new host of
   Unicorn Suite (the official NoX-Wizard site) and from the splitted softwares.
   I'll add a more sofisticated tool for check news and versions of NoX-Wizard
   in the future.
 - UG: Optimized static commands (not using anymore sprintf).
 - Fixed inline functions for use only 1 return (for borland expansion).

2003/04/10
 - Work In Progress Unicorn Suite:
   * Changed nsi script for reflect project changhes: now is named Unicorn
     GM-Tools Suite with version 0.2.
   * Included Borland RTLs in setup package, for smaller executables in the
     suite (and faster compilation).
 - UG: Creation of missing xmls files, now the setup doesn't need to include
   blanks ones.
 - Fixed problems showing hues names of 20 characters (or names that are garbage
   on the hues.mul).

2003/04/05
 - Work In Progress Unicorn Suite:
   * Moved in Common folder the common sources (utils for now)
   * Abstracted the HuesParser, now can be used in other projects also with CLX
     library
   * Rearranged the projects folder disposition. Now Common folder contains all
     the abstracted code, bin the binaries, and setup the setup-informations
   * First pre-alpha of Hues Editor, for now it doesn't works correctly and it
     doesn't save.

You can run Unicorn in Wine without problems. At least is what I would, 'cause I'm using wine too.
I'm using CVS version of Wine, at 20030819. The last release of wine [20030813] seems to have problems with treeviews, so probably you can't use Unicorn with it.
Also, the pure cvs version doesn't run Unicorn directly.
You need to set urlmon.dll and shlwapi.dll as natives [i'm using the ones from win98se], or only urlmon.dll and patch the sources with the two patches in contrib directory.
Actually, I'm not sure if you need the bcb-fix one, but if you want to run borland c++ builder [or the command line tools for make noxwizard for example] you need this patch, else ilink32 (the Turbo Incremental Linker) will freeze.
